BREAKING: Mike Huckabee Just Fired!
Submitted by MAGA Student  Posted 17 days ago  Mike Huckabee on Monday tore into Robert DeNiro for throwing f-bombs at President Trump, calling the washed up actor an “elite snob.”“Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O. Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY & DC, but in the land of "God, Guns, Grits & Gravy" ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness,” Huckabee tweeted.  https://twitter.com/govmikehuckabee/status/1006153382686584832?s=21  Last night, Anti-Trump actor DeNiro said ““F*** Trump” twice and the audience gave him a standing ovation.  As Deniro was introducing Bruce Springsteen ahead of his Tony Awards performance, the actor blurted F-Bombs at President Trump.  https://twitter.com/robbiebarstool/status/1006007717906042880?s=21  “I just want to say one thing -- F*** Trump,” DeNiro said angrily. The crowd immediately roared in a huge standing ovation from the room. "It’s no longer down with Trump. It’s f*** Trump."  CBS bleeped out DeNiro’s F-bombs, but Australia did not censor the word.

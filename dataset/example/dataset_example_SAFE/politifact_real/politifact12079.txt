It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job – Congressman Mike Honda – Medium
It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job  President Obama has taken a great deal of effort to ensure that the Supreme Court will add another extremely qualified legal scholar to the bench. Chief Judge Merrick Garland has already been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court because of his long history of excellent work on the DC Circuit. The President has chosen a man with amazing credentials, a mastery of the law and a history of independent legal thought.    This nation is built on a system of checks and balances: Executive, Legislative and the Courts. For us to be the best nation possible, we must have a full Supreme Court, ready to hear cases that will determine our future as a nation. Republican leadership in the Senate must adhere to a strict reading of the Constitution, advise the President on the nomination and vote on their consent to him joining the Court. It is time for us to put away politics and do our jobs. Americans should accept no less.

Model Introduction
===================
We have implemented a number of fake news detection algorithm models, including content-based fake news detection algorithms, social background based fake news detection algorithms, and knowledge perception based
fake news detection algorithms.

Content based
--------------
The content-based fake news detection algorithm utilizes textual and visual information in news content to
detect fake news.

Social context
---------------
The fake news detection algorithm based on social background detects and distinguishes fake news by
investigating social background information related to news articles, especially through dissemination on social media.

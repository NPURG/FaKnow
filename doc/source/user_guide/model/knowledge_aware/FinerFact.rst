**Title:** Towards Fine-Grained Reasoning for Fake News Detection

**Authors:** Yiqiao Jin1, Xiting Wang, Ruichao Yang, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang, Hao Liao, Xing Xie

**Abstract:** The detection of fake news often requires sophisticated reasoning skills, such as logically combining
information by considering word-level subtle clues. In this paper, we move towards fine-grained reasoning for fake news
detection by better reflecting the logical processes of human thinking and enabling the modeling of subtle clues. In
particular, we propose a fine-grained reasoning framework by following the humanâ€™s information-processing model, introduce
a mutual-reinforcement-based method for incorporating human knowledge about which evidence is more important, and design
a prior-aware bi-channel kernel graph network to model subtle differences between pieces of evidence. Extensive experiments
show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the explainability of our approach.

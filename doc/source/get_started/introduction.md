**FaKnow** (**Fa**ke **Know**), a unified *Fake News Detection* algorithms library based on PyTorch, is designed for
reproducing and developing fake news detection algorithms. It includes **22 models**(see at **Integrated Models**), covering **2 categories**:

- content based
- social context

## Features

- **Unified Framework**: provide a unified interface to cover a series of algorithm development processes, including data processing, model developing, training and evaluation
- **Generic Data Structure**: use json as the file format read into the framework to fit the format of the data crawled down, allowing the user to customize the processing of different fields
- **Diverse Models**: contains a number of representative fake news detection algorithms published in conferences or journals during recent years, including a variety of content-based and social context-based models
- **Convenient Usability**: pytorch based style makes it easy to use with rich auxiliary functions like loss visualization, logging, parameter saving
- **Great Scalability**: users just focus on the exposed API and inherit built-in classes to reuse most of the functionality and only need to write a little code to meet new requirements
